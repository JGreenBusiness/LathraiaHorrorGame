eyestalk spawn logic
- docile
  - similar to previous spawn logic
  - spawn at closest nest to player (determined nest)
  - find next 2 nests + previous 1 nest
  - found nests are the 'range' of the docile eye stalk
  - when player moves, move the eyestalk to the closest nest in 'range'
    - small radius
- swift
  - spawn eyestalks at every nest within a radius around player
  - this eyestalk does not switch their nest
  - make the player hate their surroundings :)

!! eyestalk spawn locations are linear (list or TArray) !!

tier3 spawns eyestalk in 'docile' state
tier4 de-spawns 'docile' eyestalk and spawns a bunch of 'swift' eyestalks
tier3->tier2 de-spawn 'docile' eyestalk

Messages go as follows:

```md
<type(s)>([scope]): < Short description>

[optional body]
```
#### Other then the initial Commit, all commits should adhere to this guide
#### Type and Message Body


- A `type` preifx in the subject line can be used to represent type of the changes included in the commit. Some of the commonly used types are:
  
  - `Add`: To summarize a new addition in the project.
  - `Mod`:  To summerize a modification made to a previous addition.
  - `Fix`: To address a fix to the project.

- `type`s can also be combined using the `/` symbol to provide further context. For example :
  - `Mod/Fix(TutorialLevel): Changed level layout and fixed clipping issues`
- A `scope` is added to a commit's type to offer additional contextual information, and it is enclosed in parenthesis, for example,

  - `Add(BP_Player): Created Player BP`.
  - `Mod(BP_Player Locomotion): Using blueprints player now has locomotion`.

 -  A `body` can be added to the message to include detailed explanations in the commit.
